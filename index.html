    <p>Hello! My name is Charlie Barski, and I am a Chemical Engineering major at Villanova University. I also have a minor in business and am a part of several clubs and societies on campus. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing golf, outdoor activities, and play on the club lacrosse team at Villanova. I am from Long Valley, NJ, which is about one hour from New York City. I have always been interested in computers and technology, and have finally gotten around to learning how to code! At school, I am also a part of Software Development Society, where each semester we work as a team to build a new application. The application we are currently working on is a school marketplace where students can buy and sell items. Most of my contributions have been to the front end of the program, but this club and itâ€™s members have inspired me to hopefully become a full stack developer one day.

        Thank you for visiting my site, it is surely a work in progress but I am excited for what my future holds.
